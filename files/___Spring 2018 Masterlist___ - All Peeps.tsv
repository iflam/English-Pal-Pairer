Morning, Afternoon, Evening	Afternoon	Morning	Afternoon, Evening	Morning	Morning, Afternoon, Evening	Morning, Afternoon, Evening	Political Science	Art, Learning Languages, Musical Instrument, Reading, Shopping, Sports / Fitness, TV/Movies/Dramas	One of the main aspects that I want to get out of my college experience at Stony Brook is meeting a wide variety of students from different backgrounds. Being in the English pal program would provide me with the opportunity to gain firsthand experience meeting new students, learning about other customs, and expanding my knowledge of various cultures beyond the classroom. Given that Stony Brook has a very large population of international students and non-native English speakers, I believe that the English pal program is an imperative component to helping these students better adjust to life at Stony Brook. Since community service has always been a significant part of my life, it is very important to me that I am able to help my peers in any way that I can and make their college experience a positive one. As a participant in the English pal program, I would be able to support and guide my peers with their transition to life at Stony Brook University and the United States from that of their native country. Helping these students to better assimilate into the culture and gain a better understanding of life in this country would make a huge impact on them. In addition to providing support to my pal with their transition, I want to give them the chance to improve their English in a more casual setting so they can more freely and comfortably communicate with others in both social and academic environments. Furthermore, by being a pal mentor, I would also serve as an academic resource for my pal, more specifically, if they need assistance with work in their courses or have questions about other programs that they could benefit from at Stony Brook.

I also want to learn how to teach and communicate with international students as it is something that I have not had the privilege of interacting with throughout my upbringing. With hopes of becoming a Calculus teacher, I would like to learn about the stories that shape another individual, but more importantly meet new people and learn from them. From this program, I plan to contribute by meeting up with my Pal and showing my Pal the way I grew up and share my stories. I would also like to share my knowledge of Stony Brook that I have learned from my involvement in various clubs and activities to ensure that my Pal is not only receiving the benefits of the English Pal program, but also Stony Brook University as a whole.   	Dear Future Pal, It is so nice to meet you! My name is Julianne. I am a freshmen majoring in Applied Mathematics and Statistics, and I can't wait to get to know you. I'm an avid fan of athletics especially running as well as travelling. I can't wait to hear about your stories and all the things you've experienced. I was born and raised just outside of New York City, and would love to show you around all my favorite places. I am a mentee in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences Peer Mentoring Program, and International Student Ambassador and an avid member of Stony Brook's Tzu Chi Chapter. If you have any questions or concerns about Stony Brook, I will try my best to answer your questions or help you seek the answer. What do you like to do in your free time? Where do you live on/off campus? and lastly, How is your Stony Brook experience so far?  - Sincerely Julianne Tung	Word of mouth, Orientation	Yes	Together	Yes, to all emails

It would be really cool to not learn about their culture, hobbies and just getting to know them as a person while helping them with speaking English. They are all very smart and capable and I might end up learning a lot from them as well. Language is a gift and it would be selfish to not share. 	Hi!

I've been in the English Pal Program since Spring 2015 ( 3 years in a row!). Over the years during my tenure at Stony Brook, I've met many exchange students particularly from South Korea; I've gained tremendous interest in the Korean/East Asian culture. As a result, I'm very passionate about going to Korea to each English. International students face many challenges such as comfortably communicating on an Americanized social level, understanding the nitty-gritty of the American Social culture, and ultimately assimilating and immersing in the American culture. There exists a thick boundary between international students and the American culture. I hope to clear/dismantle that boundary and give as much exposure as I can to the American culture from a social, economic, and intellectual standpoints. I was born and raised here in NYC ( aka the "Melting pot"), I've met various people and experienced many adventures in my life, which I"m happy to share my prospective pal. I'm just expecting to retrieve a true tangible friendship from my pal. 	Hey, let's get to know each other :) 	Facebook post, English Pal's Email	Yes	Separately	Yes, to all emails

Afternoon	Evening	Evening	Afternoon	Evening	Afternoon	Morning, Afternoon, Evening	English	Art, Cooking, Learning Languages, Reading, Sports / Fitness, TV/Movies/Dramas, Video Games / Computer Games, Writing, traveling	I want to be in the PAL program for two main reason. First because I do not learn languages well in a classroom and would like to have that personal connection to someone else. I think it would be really fun to have someone to practice with. Additionally, the structure of meeting with someone would help me to stay focused on improving language in the hecticness that is college. The second reason is because I love English and it would be fantastic to share that love with someone excited to learn. I would love to help someone feel more confident in their speaking while also making a new friend. I also find that having to explain English and its rules and intricacies helps me to better understand the language since you don’t always think about why things are the way they are until you have to explain it. I know basic Italian and would love to practice speaking it, and I am also very interested in learning Korean. 	The languages I am interested in are Italian, which I know very little, and Korean, which I have never studied, so I would ask my pal to be patient with me since they will likely know far more English than I know of their language. That being said, I firmly believe that language must be spoken and practiced to be perfected so I hope that we can both help each other become the best we can be! Also, I know a ridiculous number of unusual words which I would love to teach you to expand your vocabulary, which I think makes English so much more fun.

Throughout my childhood, I have been translating for my family since I was the only kid that had any form of proper education in the  United States. Four years ago, my mom applied for the American Citizenship test and eight months later she passed the test. Within those eight months, I taught my mom the contents of the test. We started with basic vocabulary like "president", "Independence Day" and "flag". From there, we strung words and phrases together to make sense of the sentences in the questionnaire and eventually proceeded question by question. Ultimately, the day came and  she got her citizenship. Furthermore, I want to join English Pal to meet anyone who is struggling or new to the English language because as you can see above, I understand the barriers that a new language may present.

Translating for my parents have been hectic because they expected me to help them with things like applying for drivers license or switching expired passports that require a good amount of Chinese.  However, this is also the reason why I could proudly say that I speak Chinese. Although I have not been properly taught how to read and write Mandarin in Chinese school, I can still read a sufficient amount and and type normal everyday messages.  As you can see, I am quite familiar with English and Chinese, and I have learnt some Spanish in high school but I would love to meet a person of another culture regardless if they are Chinese, Spanish, French, Greek, Italian etc...  I traveled to Spain and Portugal last spring and needless to say, the other side of the world is so different yet fascinating, hence the reason why I hope to be part of the English Pal program.  	I hope we can meet up for a cup of coffee at Starbucks and talk about how each other's day went and our majors/career and what our plans are for the week and destress abit since we were probably not going to meet by coincidence on this large campus.   :)	Word of mouth	No		Yes, but only about my pal and my progress, or surveys.

Sometimes a friendly, familiar face is all someone needs. Out of this program, I expect to make a new friend and be a source of information for the school and NY. As I end my senior year, I want to stay connected and involved with my school and schoolmates. I participated in the English Pal Program last semester and meet Jolin! She was so nice and sweet, and I enjoyed it so much that I wanted to continue the English Pal program again this semester. Now as a biomedical engineering senior, I have learned a lot from my classes, internships, and peers. My pal should never feel hesitant about asking me questions. I love questions and I think best way to learn is by showing what you don't know! If my pal has an interest in a particular major or extracurricular activity, I can connect him/her will a fellow peer. 	I love eating and sharing food!

I am trying to learn Spanish and Korean myself, so I know how sometimes speaking in a foreign language can be daunting. 	I'm so excited to meet you!

I am graduating this May and I would like to have one more pal before I leave Stony Brook. I always get so much more out of it than I give. I am still in touch with one of my pals from over 2 years ago. I expect to contribute time and energy to make my Pal feel as comfortable and confident as possible in their language and conversation skills. My goal is to bond with them, have fun, and truly make sure they have the college experience they want to have. Whether that means going to the city, trying new foods, watching movies, etc I plan on really tailoring the experience to their wants and needs and making this a semester they won't forget.

I want to be able to help those who may feel lost because of a language barrier. Also, I feel that it is important for individuals to learn colloquial, everyday language. There are many things about language that cannot just be taught in a class room setting.  Out of this program, I would like to gain a friend of a different background that I can converse with. The world is a small close knit place and it is important to accept and understand others.	I hope we get to know each other well. 	Facebook post	No		Yes, to all emails

I am expecting to meet new people from different countries who might need my help with English, who may want to learn more about the school or just want to know about different places they can visit in New York. I will be more than happy to learn about their culture and hear about their experience in the United States. I believe that this program is the best way to meet people who are from different places of the world and are open to discussing their believes and talk about their culture and make a new friend, and that's why I would love to be a part of it. Hopefully I can contribute to the program by providing not only my language knowledge but also my sharing my experience as an ESL student and an engineer.

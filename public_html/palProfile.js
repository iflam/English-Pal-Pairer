const about = <p>The English Pal Program aims to match an international student 
with a native English speaker to help the international student enhance his/her 
English conversational skills. This was also meant to provide international students 
the opportunity to meet with, and get to know a domestic Stony Brook University 
student at a more personal level â€“ an opportunity many international students want 
but do not know how to achieve. On the other hand, this provided a service opportunity 
to the students who volunteered their time to be English Pals to the international 
students.
<br/>
<br/>
The expected duration of the program is approximately 10-12 weeks
Pals will meet at minimum for 30 minutes once every week (they can feel
free to meet more/longer). There will be a mandatory information session (Meet-n-Greet Social) 
to discuss the details of the program before it starts. We usually recruit participants 
during the first two weeks of the semester.</p>;
